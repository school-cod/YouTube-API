**Data Science YouTube Channel Analysis using the YouTube API**

In this data science portfolio project, I utilized the YouTube API to analyze and gain insights from various data science-related channels on YouTube. The project aimed to understand the popularity and engagement of these channels based on video statistics such as views, likes, comments, and publish dates.Â 

The project involved the following key steps:

1. **Data Collection:** I fetched data using the YouTube API for a list of data science-related video IDs. These video IDs were associated with channels that produce content related to data science, machine learning, statistics, and related topics.

2. **Data Extraction:** Using the YouTube API, I extracted relevant information from each video, including its title, published date, view count, like count, and comment count. This data was crucial for evaluating the overall popularity and engagement of the channel's content.

3. **Data Analysis:** Once the data was collected, I performed data analysis to gain insights into the performance of each channel. This involved calculating various metrics, such as the average views per video, the average likes per video, and the average comments per video. By examining these metrics, I could identify which channels were more popular and engaging compared to others.

4. **Visualization:** To make the analysis more comprehensible, I created visualizations such as bar charts and scatter plots to showcase the distribution of views, likes, and comments across different channels. These visualizations helped in identifying trends and outliers, providing a clear representation of each channel's performance.

5. **Interpretation:** Based on the analysis and visualizations, I interpreted the findings to draw conclusions about the data science-related YouTube channels. I highlighted which channels had a higher level of engagement, whether certain topics garnered more interest, and if there were any temporal patterns in terms of publishing and engagement.

Overall, this data science portfolio project demonstrated my ability to work with APIs, extract relevant data, perform analysis, and visualize results. It showcased my skills in data collection, data manipulation, statistical analysis, and data-driven decision-making within the context of analyzing YouTube channels focused on data science content.
